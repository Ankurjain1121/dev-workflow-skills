## 5. FINAL CALCULATION

### Category Scores

| Category | Raw Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Security | X/100 | XX% | X.XX |

### Final Score

```
FINAL = (Security × 0.XX) + (Architecture × 0.XX) + (Quality × 0.XX) + (Performance × 0.XX) + (Style × 0.XX)
FINAL = X.XX + X.XX + X.XX + X.XX + X.XX
FINAL = XX.XX / 100
